# GrumpyPlayer

A simple web+HTTP home media player

This is born of the frustration of trying to keep a media server plus
player on a Kindle Fire tablet solution going for my home media.

The goal is very simple HTTP + HTML + JavaScript.

"Grumpy" because I'm sick of keeping media servers running, or logins
for hybrid tools (looking at you, Plex), or....

I want to make it as simple to use and admin as as "put a CD in the
stereo". No JavaScript frameworks. No npm bullshit. No special server
software. No indexing id3 tags. No client side apps. Just drop this
project in a directory, put the music in a Music folder underneath
that, serve the whole thing in whatever HTTP server you were already
using for your home server, play the music.
